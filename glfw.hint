ldesc: "GLFW is a free, Open Source, portable framework for OpenGL 
application development. In short, it is a single library providing a 
powerful, portable API for otherwise operating system specific tasks 
such as opening an OpenGL window, and reading keyboard, time, mouse and 
joystick input. It also provides functions accessing OpenGL extensions, 
creating and synchronizing threads and reading textures from files."
